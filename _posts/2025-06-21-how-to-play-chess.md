## 🏁 Setting Up the Chess Board

Before the first move, let’s get your board right. Here’s how:

- Place the board so that a light square is on your bottom-right corner — easy tip: *“White on right.”*
- Each player starts with 16 pieces:
  - 8 Pawns
  - 2 Rooks
  - 2 Knights
  - 2 Bishops
  - 1 Queen
  - 1 King

<chess-board fen="rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"></chess-board>

**Correct Setup:**

1. Pawns go on the second row (or *rank*) from each player.
2. Rooks in the corners.
3. Knights next to rooks.
4. Bishops next to knights.
5. The Queen goes on her own color (white queen on white square).
6. King takes the last remaining square in the row.

**White moves first**, always.

## 📦 How the Pieces Move

Understanding each piece is key to unlocking chess strategy. Each has its own style, power, and purpose. Let’s explore them!

---

### 👑 King

![King](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Chess_klt45.svg)

- The **King** is your most important piece.
- Moves one square in *any direction* — horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
- You must keep your king safe at all costs — if he's threatened and can't escape, it’s *checkmate*.

<chess-board fen="8/8/8/3K1k2/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1" highlight="d5,e5,d4,e4,c5,c4,c6,d6,e6" arrows="d5-e5,d5-d4,d5-e4,d5-c4,d5-c5,d5-c6,d5-d6,d5-e6"></chess-board>

🛡️ *Tip: Castling helps safeguard your king — more on that later!*

---

### 👸 Queen

![Queen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Chess_qlt45.svg)

- The **Queen** is the most powerful piece.
- She can move *any number of squares* vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
- Use her for aggressive attacks, tactical threats, or long-range support.

<chess-board fen="8/8/8/3Q4/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1" arrows="d5-d8,d5-d1,d5-a5,d5-h5,d5-a2,d5-h1,d5-a8,d5-g8">
</chess-board>

👑 *Promotion: When a pawn reaches the other side of the board, it often becomes a queen.*

---

### 🏰 Rook

![Rook](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Chess_rlt45.svg)

- The **Rook** moves in straight lines — either across ranks or files.
- It's excellent for endgame power plays and controlling open lines.
- A rook pairs wonderfully with the king for the special move called **castling**.

<chess-board fen="8/8/8/3R4/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1" highlight="d5,d1,d2,d3,d4,d6,d7,d8,a5,b5,c5,e5,f5,g5,h5" arrows="d5-d1,d5-d8,d5-a5,d5-h5"></chess-board>

🔧 *Rooks are often quiet early in the game but become stars in the endgame.*

---

### ⛪ Bishop

![Bishop](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Chess_blt45.svg)

- Bishops move diagonally and have long reach.
- They stay on the color they started on for the entire game.
- A pair of bishops can control wide zones of the board when working together.

<chess-board fen="8/8/8/3B4/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1" highlight="d5,a2,g8,a8,g2" arrows="d5-a2,d5-g8,d5-a8,d5-g2"></chess-board>

⚔️ *Keep your bishops active — they’re deadly in open positions!*

---

### 🐴 Knight

![Knight](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Chess_nlt45.svg)

- The **Knight** moves in an “L” shape: two squares in one direction, then one square perpendicular.
- It's the only piece that can *jump over others*.
- Great for forking (attacking two pieces at once) and controlling central squares.

<chess-board fen="8/8/8/3N4/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1" highlight="c7,e7,b6,f6,b4,f4,c3,e3" arrows="d5-c7,d5-e7,d5-b6,d5-f6,d5-b4,d5-f4,d5-c3,d5-e3"></chess-board>

🔄 *Knights are tricksters — place them near the center for maximum impact!*

---

### ⚔️ Pawn

![Pawn](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Chess_plt45.svg)

- Pawns move forward one square, or two squares from their starting position.
- They capture diagonally and can *never move backward*.
- Upon reaching the last rank, a pawn can promote to any piece (except the king).

<chess-board fen="8/8/8/3P4/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1" highlight="d6,c6,e6" arrows="d5-d6,d5-c6,d5-e6">
</chess-board>

🪙 *Don’t underestimate pawns — they may start small but can end up queens!*

## 📜 Essential Rules of Chess

Beyond movement, chess has unique rules that make it exciting and strategic.

- **Check**: The king is under attack. You must respond.
- **Checkmate**: The king is trapped. Game over.
- **Stalemate**: The player has no legal moves, but the king isn't in check. It’s a draw.
- **Castling**: A move that slides the king two squares toward a rook, and the rook jumps over.

<chess-board fen="r3k2r/8/8/8/8/8/8/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 1" arrows="e1-g1,h1-f1,e1-c1,a1-d1"></chess-board>

- **En Passant**: A special pawn capture that can happen immediately after an opponent moves their pawn two squares forward.

<chess-board fen="8/8/8/3pP3/8/8/8/8 w - d6 0 1" arrows="e5-d6"></chess-board>

- **Pawn Promotion**: A pawn reaching the far end of the board becomes another piece (usually a queen).

<chess-board fen="4P3/8/8/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1" arrows="e8-e7"></chess-board>
